Episode 16: Background Tiles
============================

Problem
--------

- Certain tiles that Quote walks in front of:
    - buildings
    - doorways
    - beds
    - chains
    - etc.

Solution
--------

- Another double vector of Sprites (not tiles)
- Background sprite-tiles don't have an impact on Quote ever, so they can just
  be sprites

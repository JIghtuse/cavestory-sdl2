Episode 27: Timers
==================

Problem
--------

- Have a couple of "time-keeping" variables, all updated identically

Solution
--------

- Organize logic into a Timer class (given: expiration time)
- At any point, we need to know: expired? active? current time?
- Bonus: self-updating timers
